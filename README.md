The hello-world repository is a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program, and as such is often the very first program people write. \[Wikipedia contributors, ""Hello, World!" program," Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%22Hello,_World!%22_program&oldid=842325772 (accessed May 27, 2018).\]
